  title: "Aerobridge Server API specification"
  description: |-
    All the interfaces for the Aerobridge server are defined here, using these APIs, you can interact with management server, store flight plans, issue flight permissions. We recommend using a authorised GCS e.g. Aerobridge Guardian with Aerobridge management server. 

    The API is a limited subset of all the functionality of the Management server and focuses on interactions with GCS / external software. Aerobridge server also provides a user interface as well and this API works in conjunction with that user interace. 

    Unless otherwise specified, fields specified in a message but not declared in the API shall be ignored.

        Openskies provides a open-source OAUTH server: [https://id.openskies.sh](https://id.openskies.sh), it or any OAUTH 2.0 server that can issue JWT tokens can be used to conrol acceess. Access is controlled via access tokens that are JSON Web Tokens as defined in RFC 7519, using the `RS256` algorithm for the signature, publish to all providers the public key for verifying that signature, and implement standard OAuth server discovery mechanisms as described in RFC 8414.

        The following fields shall be included in the JWT claim for access tokens issued by this authority:
            * `iss`, with the URL at which the token generation request was received.
            * `exp`, with a time no further than 1 hour in the future.
            * `sub`, with unique ID of the client requesting the access token.
            * `scope`, with a list of space-separated strings (per RFC 6749) indicating the scopes granted.
            * `jti`, according to RFC 7519.

        Clients shall provide these access tokens in an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>` in accordance with RFC 6750.
